Les Habitu√©s - Technical Test

You're an external partner, and need to save the shops we work with. New shops are regularly being added to the API, so your system will have to request our API often to pull the updated data. You will also need to create or update shops later on from other parts of your project.

    Request the data from the route : https://www.leshabitues.fr/testapi/shops
    Parse the response and store the necessary content that a frontend developer will be using later on.
    Shop entities data can be updated or created in the future. Structure your code to plan any necessary needs to easily create, update, delete a Shop entity in the future from other parts of your project. (Services, Factory, Manager, Exceptions ...)

Rules to follow

    You must commit regularly so we can follow your progress with an initial empty commit when you start the test

Deliverables

    The link to the git repository
    Several commits, with an explicit message each time
    Docker project or setup instructions.
    A separate file or email documenting your process and principles you've followed
